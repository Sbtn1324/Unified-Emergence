Unified Emergence Framework – Key Symbolic Proposals

1. Contact Equation: C = (∇T) ⋅ R
   - C: Contact
   - ∇T: Gradient of spacetime tension
   - R: Rate of recursive deformation
   Describes the generation of emergent gravity via curvature response.

2. Perceptual Time: τ_p = ∫ R(t) dt
   - τ_p: Perceived time
   - R(t): Rate of change perceived by consciousness
   Integrates the effect of cognition on temporal awareness.

3. Emergence Loop Index: ε = C * Ψ
   - ε: Emergence magnitude
   - Ψ: Curvature stressor set
   Shows how layered emergence scales in relation to structural complexity.
