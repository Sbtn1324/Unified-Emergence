## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The **Unified Emergence Framework (UEF)** is a novel theoretical model that reimagines the nature of spacetime, gravity, time, and consciousness as **emergent phenomena** â€” not fixed laws. This modular system integrates physics, symbolic logic, and philosophical inquiry into one coherent architecture.

UEF is grounded in three foundational theories:

- **ETF** â€“ Energy is fundamental; gravity emerges as a stress response  
- **Timeless** â€“ Time is subjective, arising from reasoning and perception  
- **SCH** â€“ Consciousness is recursive curvature interacting with intention  

Together, they offer a new explanation of reality built on **recursive structure, causality, and curvature**.

## ðŸ”¬ Key Equations

```
1. Contact:         C = (âˆ‡T) â‹… R
2. Perceived Time:  Ï„â‚š = âˆ« R(t) dt
3. Emergence:       Îµ = C * Î¨
```

Where:
- `âˆ‡T` = spacetime tension gradient  
- `R` = recursion rate  
- `Î¨` = stressor profile set
